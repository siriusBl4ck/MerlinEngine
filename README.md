# MerlinEngine
OpenGL and Game Engine Dev
This started as a follow through of some modern OpenGL programmable pipeline tutorials I found.
But slowly, I began to explore on my own, add some changes and try new things.

- Can load flat 2d textures
- Model loading is in progress
- Can load different scenes, and scenes can be configured by the user using their own class, and they can define which models they want to use and where they want to place it in their own scene class
- Uses OpenGL 4.5, GLFW.
